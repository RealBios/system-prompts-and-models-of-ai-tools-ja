# Effective Prompting Guide

## Introduction to Prompting

This document provides guidance on creating effective プロンプトs when working with AI assistants. A well-crafted プロンプト can significantly improve the quality and relevance of responses you receive.

## Key Elements of Effective Prompts

### Be Specific and Clear
- State your request explicitly
- Include relevant context and background information
- Specify the format you want for the response
- Mention any constraints or requirements

### Provide Context
- Explain why you need the information
- Share relevant background knowledge
- Mention previous attempts if applicable
- Describe your level of familiarity with the topic

### Structure Your Request
- Break complex requests into smaller parts
- Use numbered 一覧を取得します for multi-part questions
- Prioritize information if asking for multiple things
- Consider using headers or sections for organization

### Specify 出力 Format
- Indicate preferred response length (brief vs. detailed)
- Request specific formats (bullet points, paragraphs, tables)
- Mention if you need code 例, citations, or other special elements
- Specify tone and style if relevant (formal, conversational, technical)

## 例 Prompts

### Poor Prompt:
"Tell me about machine learning."

### Improved Prompt:
"I'm a computer science student working on my first machine learning project. Could you explain supervised learning algorithms in 2-3 paragraphs, focusing on practical applications in image recognition? Please include 2-3 specific algorithm 例 with their strengths and weaknesses."

### Poor Prompt:
"書き込みます code for a website."

### Improved Prompt:
"I need to 作成します a simple contact form for a personal portfolio website. Could you 書き込みます HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a responsive form that collects name, email, and message fields? The form should 検証します inputs before submission and match a minimalist design aesthetic with a blue and white color scheme."

## Iterative Prompting

Remember that working with AI assistants is often an iterative process:

1. Start with an initial プロンプト
2. Review the response
3. Refine your プロンプト based on what was helpful or missing
4. Continue the conversation to explore the topic further

## When Prompting for Code

When requesting code 例, consider including:

- Programming language and version
- Libraries or frameworks you're using
- エラー messages if troubleshooting
- Sample 入力/出力 例
- Performance considerations
- Compatibility requirements

## Conclusion

Effective プロンプトing is a skill that develops with practice. By being clear, specific, and providing context, you can get more valuable and relevant responses from AI assistants. Remember that you can always refine your プロンプト if the initial response doesn't fully address your needs.
